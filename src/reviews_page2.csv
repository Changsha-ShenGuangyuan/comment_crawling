"Pokemon Player (Magic)",5,"I love this game! it reminds me of Vampire Survivors! I love the abilities, game play, the game loop, the guns, everything! I love the unique enemies that change up the game. Enemies that force you to move. I just love the game. and the Ads omg the ads are perfectly placed. you can watch them to benefit you4 gameplay or not. You aren't forced to watch ads and I think that is perfect. 10/10 I love this game!","2024-01-15T17:35:47.163Z"
"ayden",5,"amazing game, it poses a good challenge and can take sometime to get used too but for those who are willing to practice it's really fun but there are a few bugs like how some of the upgrades only do a fraction of what they say they do and you can't get anything that involves watching an ad but if those get fixed then this is pretty much a perfect game, i highly reccomend playing this game","2024-01-24T04:46:44.974Z"
"teyhey pointless hyper",5,"so its a bullet hell but youre the one causing hell at the start its pretty difficult but the build up as you collect more upgrades and slowly get stronger until eventually your screen is absolutely covered in bullets and the enemies just dissappear its so cool and the different weapons and characters pretty cool it would be cooler if the guns had their own specific upgrades would've made it perfect but the characters having their own upgrades make up for it.","2023-09-26T18:58:59.485Z"
"sandy",5,"its so cool. a format thats very popular but finally realized to its full potential. best stylized pixed game ever","2024-07-14T05:55:40.502Z"
"William Irons",5,"amazing game. Loved it, but it does force a lot of ads at you sometimes","2024-07-31T06:52:36.781Z"
"Sapphire",5,"This is one of the only games I have found that is not only a simple rpg game but also has beautiful style. The way the art of the game and the gaming interacts, is a master piece. It's not too hard, not too easy. This game was a miracle in disguise. Definitely recommend for anyone interested in a rpg game but doesn't want to go hardcore shout out.","2022-12-23T09:46:34.340Z"

"SHOCK WORLD DESTROYER",5,"this game is just too good it's hard but good(or I just have a skill issue) although there should be more content maybe cosmetics too I really only have one gameplay issue the eyes that shoot at me, make their shots a different color pls,I always get hit by it thinking it's my shot, you could also change the weapon and shot color so everything looks more diverse yknow . aside from that the game is amazing just don't leave it in the dustüíÄ","2022-11-07T02:04:19.216Z"
"Carson Matthews",5,"This is an absolutely amazing game. Perfect for any short break and can never take up more than 20 minutes (until they add an endless mode). I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of 'Vampire Survivors' as I'm mostly certain that was the main inspiration. I even ended up downloading this on my tablet as well so that I can play it when my phone dies. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê although my opinion may not matter much, Beautiful work devs üëå","2022-11-25T03:42:08.798Z"
"Alamin Assad",5,"Honestly walked into this one with mid expectations. As far as performance the games runs flawlessly and has native controller support. üëå Playwise, game starts slow and with some effort at learning the buffs and synergies and what each character can do you quickly become a boss unto yourself. My only gripe is that 20 minutes is too short so far. Currently pushing up the difficulty every session and greatly enjoying it. protip: unlock with with Google pass to get unlimited credits","2024-03-02T07:03:20.150Z"
"Jordan Barlow",5,"Played this game a ton on PC, paid $5 for it on that and I'd pay another $5 for it on mobile. The controls translate over well enough to mobile but I will say overall they need to brighten the game a bit. Even sitting in a dark room it can be a bit hard to see (a problem PC does not share). Outside of that I think the game is fantastic. Very repayable with a few very fun and creative upgrades. My favorite at the moment is a high HP smite build. Oh also the Devs have been very active so far 10/10","2022-12-06T03:48:28.780Z"
"Andy",5,"I usually don't play mobile games. Definitely not a bullet hell gamer but at the price point of 0 dollars and the gameplay doesn't involve serious in game purchases to progress. I give it a thumbs up. the controls are kinda booty on touch screen but a spare Xbox one controller alleviates that issue.","2023-08-09T02:04:11.990Z"
"–ë–µ—Ä–Ω–∞—Ü—å–∫–∏–π ¬´DimaBe¬ª –î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–æ",5,"It plays great, I really enjoyed it. The interface is convenient, performing achievements in places due to misstaps, I thought I ruined the achievement, but the genius who forgives such a trifle is simply the best. Despite its gameplay, it does not load the device as some kind of brand new Surviv, which, well, really fu. Everything is thought out here, but it seems to me that in some places you are pumping too imbalanced. But these little things do not interfere with enjoying the game.","2022-12-26T22:22:28.480Z"
"Star Cheeto",5,"Excellent and simple bullet hell. I have the premium on pc, the free mobile version I play when traveling. Each character and weapon feels unique and the different combinations can vary up gameplay quite a bit. Theres room for more enemy variety, environmental hazards, and bosses or elites. In its current state, it is a fun game with enough to bite into.","2023-12-22T01:00:01.509Z"
"Matheus Salabert",5,"Simply one of the best shooters I've played in years. It's repetitive but just provides different upgrades that makes it enjoyable and replayable. P.S I think there are things that could be better tho. How there's no setting for a fixed joystick? Or a menu that I can check every matching upgrade.","2022-11-26T03:29:54.627Z"
"David Stark",5,"Amazing game. I'm a sucker for pixelated graphics, so this game is great if you also like retro graphics. I love roguelike games, so another plus, and the upgrades and their synergies provide so much variation. Ads are always annoying, but I'm willing to put that aside for this amazing game.","2023-05-18T10:51:25.107Z"
"Daekwan Christmas",5,"this is incredibly fun to play,it can be a challenge but in a way that make entertaining it plenty of different builds and weapons that effect how you can play the game allowing more variety to the gameplay. I Highly recommend giving this game a try you might find a new favorite game like I did. Great job dev team.","2022-11-20T22:18:50.416Z"
"Crimson Afterburner",5,"Great fun where the simple mechanics and strategic depths can give you a hell of a lot of playtime. It's free options are awesome but I do believe that this game is quality enough to support the full release. 100% Completion and each of those moments were either fun or a good challenge.","2023-12-01T14:04:55.171Z"
"Austin LoanSome",5,"I love this game, it's so good. I love the vibe, the graphics, the characters and the skill tree that gives you these ultimate bonuses if you get the right ones. It's only gotten better with time. And thank you for bringing back Lilith and adding Luna, plus the magic bow. Exceptional game and devs.","2023-10-18T01:27:16.936Z"
"Shawn Louis",5,"One lf the more difficult survival game I have played it feels like the grind is worth it more as you get stronger upgrading stats, and finding the synergies are always fun in these types of games. I also like to see how much the abilities do compared to others, so if you can add that to the game that would be nice :)","2022-11-28T05:31:32.810Z"
"Roland Palmer",5,"The limited ammo and reloads adds more interactivity to the actual shooting and the upgrade trees are really fun. Plenty of options on how to buff yourself and there's a good balance with feeling super powerful without the enemy patterns feeling too easy. Visuals and sounds also lend themselves a lot to the feel","2023-08-01T02:32:12.203Z"
"Sean Gumabay",5,"I love the game, by that I mean, I love how you can just use Lilith with the batgun, prioritize summon damage, stand in the middle of the arena and spam basic attack till you have like.... 700+ spirits surrounding you while you do nothing and win. Please nerf her, atleast put a limit to her abilities Caz it's literally crashing my game how many spirits and bats roam around, maybe make it so that no more than 50 bats exist and no more than 100 spirits exist at the same time.","2024-05-11T17:40:55.501Z"
"Philip Abraham",5,"Such a brilliant game! It's punishing if you don't pay your way through but when you do survive it's good stuff. Hack and slash meets rogue like in game upgrades","2024-06-09T17:49:27.950Z"
"Rashi Bhardwaj",5,"It's amazing but sometimes seems endless and also it is definitely not an easy game but yeah better than thousands of other game .haven't really seen any ad till now and also highly recommended and a hidden gem","2024-06-06T17:22:40.312Z"
"Stuff",5,"I think it's a very fun spin on your average run and gun type game, but opposed to most I've played it's actually difficult enough to stay fun.","2024-05-19T04:31:48.568Z"
"Funny Violin",5,"Just plain fun, and a big thank you to the devs for not showing ads down our throats. Would be happy to buy premium when I get the opportunity.","2024-06-14T22:11:31.608Z"

"Jager Cerjance",5,"with all the upgrades making every run unique i have an absurd amount of fun on this game. the only two issues i have is the lag in frame drop when there are a screen full of enemies which the game kind of specializes in taking down hordes making it hard to play on later runs even with a god phone. second issue i want more gunsü¶ß (endless would be cool too)","2022-11-24T22:18:52.787Z"

"Timmy",5,"The ""free"" Play Pass coins aren't being added. It's essentially a fun game but straight from the beginning it's way too hard. Try Again. Edit: Whoa! Didn't expect the issue to be fixed this fast. Well done and much more enjoyable to play now. Also kudos on the professional reply. Thanks!","2023-06-07T19:02:12.140Z"
"Don Pog",5,"Once you start unlocking runes, weapons and people it becomes less stressful grinding the exp. Lilith is great with the bats. Diamond is tricky to master but end result is very exhilarating. Spark is fun with the right set up. Shana - don't forget the halo pieces. Note to editor- An endless survival mode would be fun. It does have a peak once everything is completed so repayable factor dies after a bit.","2022-12-11T02:43:43.122Z"
"Junior C",5,"First Impressions, I love the graphics of the game, it's simplistic yet contrast colours for the background, and the overall gameplay. My biggest pet peeve for free games are ads, but this one doesn't riddle you with it every 5 minutes and handles it like the game soul knight. Overall, very recommend for this kind of shoot em up. A good past time game on the go.","2022-12-01T00:22:04.549Z"
"R√∏s√® Private",5,"Its a very good game. it doesn't get annoying pr repetitive due to how many options you have like different weapons characters and upgrades. I have no complaints but I do think the time to wait for the holy shield to return should be reduced to 1and a half minutes instead of 2 minutes","2022-12-09T07:08:53.419Z"
"Francgod Gaud",5,"Smartphone games are usually terrible but 20 min is just one the best its inspired by Vampire Survivor and it does it great, my only suggestion would be to make the sprite of your summons more distinguishable and different from the monsters, since they share a similar pallet its hard to detect what is a friend or a foe. Barely any adds you can watch one before your run for a small advantage but not neccessary beside that no adds.. amazing props to the Dev team !","2022-12-04T22:24:09.238Z"
"Flip",5,"holly this is a fun game. it has the fun rougelike element of trying again and again to pick the right items character and weapons. i did not expect a power fansty but BOY is it good because you WORKED FOR THAT. you worked for that feeling. its been a hot minute since i genuinely enjoyed a game this much there is still a difficulty curve i love that feeling of finally getting an amazing run with all the right power ups and then mowing down every enemy in sight. absolutely incredible game 9.2/10","2023-04-29T07:02:37.150Z"
"Dragon XD",5,"Amazing game for when you wanna relax for 20 min, really helps with stress. i hope the developers come up with more perks as the game goes on ,i think they need more. Also why do i need to be online for the game to start i understand you need the ads for revenue, but pls make it so i can the start the game without needing to connect to the internet so i can play it whenever i want to. I also want to thank the developers for putting ads only when you want benefits at the start of a gameüôÇ","2022-12-06T08:28:58.508Z"
"Joshua Kingston",5,"Great game, music is cool, character and weapon options feel really impactful, and the game is actually challenging, which is nice considering every other mobile game seems to want to hold ur hand the whole way.

"WONDERS ASOLUKA",5,"Superb I've had this game for a few months now Came back to it fully ending of last month and it was pretty fun Though I died a lot at the start after grinding a bit and finding the best convo for everything the game went pretty smoothly The only issue I have is that sometimes during darkness lv 15 when I'm using a weaker weapon and the enemies are piling up the app starts to struggle I dunno if it's my phone but fixing that would be good Any other issue and suggestions will be mailed","2024-01-15T21:34:06.538Z"
"Motivated Male",5,"Dark and edgy atmosphere-check Fun abilities-check Fun gameplay-check Great replayability-check Just the way I like it,20 minutes till dawn is an amazing game. The pixelized art style really suits the overall atmosphere and setting.

I can play this game for hours on end and never get bored whatsoever.","2023-05-07T15:24:32.366Z"
"TCN Diamond",5,"One of the best mobile games I've therally enjoyed. It just never becomes boring and it's always satisfying to get new upgrades to destroy your enemies. One thing I wish it had was a leader board to see. How long others have survived or maybe an endless mode as well","2023-05-06T10:37:31.687Z"
"Sorathorn Suthanapan",5,"Very polished survivor game. Multiple playstyle to unlock and explore. Dual stick control one for movement, the other for aimshots or you can just hold it down to attack the closest enemy. Also has sick graphics. Highly recommend giving the game a go. Not to mention it's free. No real pay wall either.","2022-12-27T17:07:54.316Z"
"shiyaniera",5,"Was able to break the game with one of the characters to the point where the game was crawling at 1 frame per second. 5 stars; it was hilarious.

"Rafa Amor",5,"The game is very fun to play but it is a bit hard for most players like I did manage to finithe first 20 minutes but at the last second the give me a boss which is easy to beat but I didn't manage to beat it because I didn't know it's attack but it's very fun and addictive I really recommend it but you do have to read carefully the options they have for power ups and choose the most both offensive and defensive power ups to stay the distance and attack while running so it's fun and addictive","2024-03-01T15:32:20.932Z"
"Hunter Mullins",5,"Most likely the best roguelike for mobile phones, and there's no ads unless you want a small bonus.

"Lumpia Lifeafter",5,"Ten out of Ten, Satisfied, felt large power coming thru my veins after winning, kinda easy yet too challenging, probably would play more if I don't have something or assignments to do but here's the thing, just one time please can you make some like a boss music or any music like thrilling for players ears you know, more like to enhance the environment and (something something I can't remember) on the game, It's nice for a pixelated game, Would be better, keep up your good work Devs Lol, See ya!","2022-12-14T13:18:55.310Z"
"eli334",5,"Very good game! It's hard on PC but it's exponentially harder on mobile, but that's to be expected. Most synergies feel well balanced, and the game itself is fun (and chaotic). 9.5/10 (sometimes I feel like I take damage when I shouldn't, but again, mobile)","2022-11-24T21:47:42.872Z"
"AEsir Re:Born",5,"First of all, I think it's not hard and secondly, I RETRACT MY SENTENCE FOR SAYING IT'S NOT HARD, The game has so much to offer and thinking that if you can beat it just by choosing upgrades that are overpowered, It's just not making it easy for you, It's making it hard for you like this game really ignited my gaming skills, I like it like no. I LOVE IT. Similar to Soul Knight but with great challenges and collectibles. I guess if you were thinking is this game worth to buy the premium? I Think?","2022-11-13T16:21:28.390Z"

"Ben Arnao",5,"Best mobile game for this genre. The monetization is reasonable... Watch an ad when you die which will probably be 5 or so times a match.

This game is eerily similiar but way more polished, so levelling up and upgrading certain stuff for me is ultra fast, since i already know the drill. This game is definitely more casual for those who likes chaotic bullet-hell shmup game. They do not show you ads at all (only for retries or certain stuff) and it's an ""easy to learn hard to master"" type. Definitly worth a try if anyone is interested in this game.","2022-12-16T03:37:00.838Z"
"Soren C",5,"Very fun n unique rogueshooter. My only complaints are for 2 things, their seems to be an auto-aim so when I go to shoot it'll shoot 1 ammo at whatever it's aiming at before I fully control it, which has gotten me hit more than once. The other is that when you lvl up and select your upgrade it's supposed to push enemies too close a little bit away so u have time to actually start shooting again, but theirs like a 50% chance it'll just decide not to work which has also gotten me killed.","2022-12-07T13:04:54.134Z"

And wish you add more kinds of enemies, more modes and more combat abilities. about graphics i honestly didn't like the screen effects its kinda too much that you can't see probably but its ok wish you make it better in the next updates.

"Hunter Trax",5,"Excellent game in terms of gameplay, though perhaps a bit lacking in terms of run variety when compared with other VS-likes. My only complaint is that things should be highlighted a bit better when using the controller, otherwise this is a definite recommend.","2023-07-18T20:27:38.406Z"
"Tim Danver Paneda Zamora",5,"I pre-registered because the game looks cool and I was right. The graphics is good, the game gets repetitive but yeah, that's what it is. Abby and her weapon is broken as hell, especially in end game. I only got to the 2nd stage since I got bored though. I might come back if I missed this. I hope there will be more updates and stuffs.","2022-11-09T17:17:37.940Z"

"Mitch Anchondo",5,"Amazing roguelite bullet-hell game ported from the PC. Been playing the PC version for some time. The game is balanced well in this phone version, likely to accommodate how it plays on a touch screen control scheme. It reminds me of Magic Survival for the phone but feels like Enter The Gungeon or Neon Abyss to me with how crazy runs can get. Once I'm at the 15 minute mark with the right build, I feel like a female witch version of the Doom Slayer mowing everything down","2022-12-27T02:17:42.912Z"
"Jamie Ross-Gillespie",5,"Awesome game, really really fun! Just a few things I would add, is a way to keep your progress, and a way to transfer your progress to the premium version. And some more options, weapons and characters. But other than that, highly recommend","2022-11-28T10:17:36.591Z"
"Atlas Greenfield",5,"I have this game on steam and it's pretty much a perfect mobile replica, sure it's missing a couple of upgrade trees but that's to be expected. I must say, if I had to change one thing I'd implement a controls button so you can see how to play.","2022-11-21T08:05:35.260Z"

Love it.","2022-12-24T03:04:33.577Z"
"Uday Narayan Mukherjee",5,"Great game. I wanted to encourage the developer so I paid for a level. It would be great if the devs would make it for other platforms (steam or ps5).

"Shannon Berridge",5,"I'm just reviewing the game as a whole, not the actual phone experience as my play time is on PC. From what I can tell though this plays and controls very smooth. Games amazing rouge like. Just one more turn all night. Really good for pick up and play sessions too.","2023-02-17T13:21:50.619Z"
"Elliot",5,"It's a sublime game, grants you hours and hours of pure fun, shoots, explosion and tons of enemies. It turned out as my favorite game recently, not that I played many games before, I don't do the fanatic gamer type so much. This work of art is beautiful and perfect in various aspects, such as art(man I love pixel art, and this game made it so masterfully) which is pretty stylish by the way; the gunshot sounds and other sounds in general, the gameplay is pretty fluid too. Loved it.","2023-10-07T06:32:25.423Z"
"Chris P. Bacon",5,"This game has no tutorials and wants you to learn the game little by little. Through mistakes you learn what the environment and the enemies can do to you and little by little you start being better at the game. The feeling of accomplishment you achieve after winning once is fun.","2023-07-11T22:43:45.827Z"
"Jacob Wecker",5,"Solid game. Fun combos and progression with no ads unless you want them which I really really appreciate.

"Ice Tide",5,"Don't rate too many games, but this is a really fun horde-based rogue like that is very respectful towards your time. A run takes twenty minutes, only ten if you prefer, which is way more reasonable than most. And the gameplay is actually really fun! Add regular updates and you've got something perfect right here.","2022-11-18T22:43:37.970Z"
"Isai Saputra",5,"The game are absolutely fantastic. It plays smoothly, and every run you'll always discover something fun. True, there is always an ""ideal"" build for each character, but the fun starts when you're forced to go to the different route!","2023-12-06T12:05:04.220Z"
"Raylei Jayn",5,"Amazing game,dunno why I need to have an internet before playing tho,maybe for just the ads in revive that doesn't work? As you could play this even without internet connection honestly,as just open the game with internet connection and after opening the game we could just turn off the internet connection and still play it,overall it's a good game,would love if you add boss rush and stuff that makes everything more chaotic tho.","2022-12-06T15:22:30.710Z"
"Soup",5,"this game is the peak of 2d top horde survival. i just love watching my grenade launcher do such damage. the only thing im mildly annoyed about though is that both the enemy and you, yourself, got the same color on the bullets, so when you're at the 5 min mark when the boss with the laser attacks spawns and spawn the one eyed creatures too its really hard to figure out what to doge quickly so you are generally guaranteed to loose hp. although i love the rune upgrade yall added","2022-11-10T18:36:42.998Z"
"Dr. Notfake",5,"Fantastic take on the Vampire Survivors genre. The devs put thought and work into this, and the ads are fair. It's a good game for extended sessions - you'll need at least 10 minutes to complete a round. Art is decent to good quality. Overall, very recommended!","2022-12-10T13:50:29.997Z"
"„Ç∞„Ç¶„Ç∏Kagamine",5,"Addicting and solid game to play before sleeping or getting back to work. I do have onr concern regarding the cyclone sword, ai hope it can be updated based on which upgrade you use visually like the guns. And another mode named invasion or something where it's double the time (40mins) and is higher in difficulty after clearing the 15 darkness levels. Mainly because I'm having fun 20mins isn't enough","2024-01-19T03:28:06.422Z"
"EstoyDoi",5,"I didn't imagine enjoying too much for this game. Having this retro style graphics is smart so whenever the run becomes chaotic, it wont heat your phone too much. The mechanics are simple. You just need to be smart for the synergies and have fun. 5 stars.","2022-12-25T07:01:03.169Z"

"Brandon Austin Uy",5,"It is the most fun to play with selectable abilities and a lot of characters to choose from with skill based implementation.

"Utkarsh Talwar",5,"This game makes you feel like death incarnate, raining down hellfire upon hordes and hordes of vile-looking enemies.
