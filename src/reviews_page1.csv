"residualfail",5,"This was originally a 3 star for me because of what felt like a major character/weapon imbalance. I just replayed a few hours and it seems like there was some major rebalancing since my last playthrough. It feels like they brought the majority of the characters close to par with each other. THANK YOU! A couple character/weapon combos still seem a smidge op but balance is hard, and the devs managed to make ALL characters and weapons interesting! 5 out of 5, I want more moar maps now haha","2024-09-10T13:12:28.551Z"
"Barrie Corbitt",5,"How is it that the free version has more content than the premium one. I am not sure what exactly the developers are thinking here but I've pretty much unlocked everything on premium bar 1 weapon but here there's tons to do. Still a great game. There's more content in this version than in premium game it genuinely baffles me. If devs are reading this please add some sort of menu that's accessible during gameplay that tells the player what bonus can be obtained for combining the abilities thanks","2024-08-19T07:56:14.141Z"
"David Amos",5,"Bought this on PC the day it launched and it has come a long way. It was 5 stars when it first came out, and 5 stars now. Great game. Minimalistic visuals, fun upgrades, variety of enemies. Can't wait for their next game.","2024-09-10T04:07:26.659Z"
"Cedric Lindsey",5,"pretty fun without constantly drowning you in ads. 10 mins of gaming and I got to pick the ads I wanted to watch. and they came with some good rewards so this is actually a decent mobile game. unlike those others that are just ads with some idle gameplay.","2024-09-04T18:33:21.420Z"
"Jordan Cruz",5,"Excellent mobile shoot 'em up, a fair bit of difficulty and choice available. It's a battery killer, but functions well and is one of the first mobile games I've played that doesn't feel dumbed down.","2024-08-30T00:02:35.324Z"
"Conor Lively",5,"I have enjoyed playing this game. The game is difficult, but not too difficult. Unlocking characters and weapons seems balanced enough for me as some are purchased through in-game currencies and some require actual money. The gameplay is fun and exciting and the graphics add to the overall atmosphere of the game.","2024-07-17T04:47:14.259Z"

"Jasper Cain-Sweet",5,"Wonderful! I love the simplicity of the 12 colors(or more) unlike other games with much more colors, another thing is the pixelation is very nice because to me it makes it more appealing. this and more included with the chaos of what you can make with such combinations of upgrades, overall it's great!","2024-07-06T02:24:45.834Z"
"Jessey Mark Aranda",5,"This GAME in particular is truly one of a kind. Would like to have more Weapons, Maps, Characters, especially an Endless Mode would be a must. As i said best game to be made, looking forward for more updates!! W for the Game, W for the Devs.","2024-08-10T16:15:57.564Z"
"Ricky Donne",5,"Initially I was having some difficulty surviving 20 mins. After few tries, i got the hang of it. Gotta say you won't get bored because of the amazing replayability. You can also combine different characters and weapons and try experimenting.","2024-07-12T15:33:03.481Z"

""Easy to understand?"" DEFINITELY! ""how about Free to play?"" Yeah. Overall the game is a massive win if you download, sooo fun.. (I think I'm addicted to it!)","2024-07-10T22:11:34.456Z"
"Luke Ang",5,"Fantastic game. I wish there were more synergies, like a ""close damage"" synergy with smite and glare, or a ""light and dark"" synergy with smite and curse. Some balancing is needed for some skills' scaling, for example smite's scaling is barely usable at higher darkness even with max HP whereas curse basically clears the screen. I would also love to be able to be more intentional with builds, such as by being able to choose a skill to permanently remove from the choice cool every few levels, etc.","2024-06-06T04:22:01.720Z"
"AJ Wilson",5,"Great shmup/rouge lite survival game with many different characters, weapons and abilities. Survive by killing enemies for 20 min while constantly upgrading. Different abilities unlock branch abilities, or combine for bonuses. Experiment with different combinations to find what works best for your play style Once you survive the difficulty gets a little harder the next round, up to 15 times. There are also 2 bonus locations to unlock, and some extra cosmetic stuff.","2024-05-26T00:45:16.311Z"
"Reagan",5,"One of THE BEST free survival games I've played. The movement is simple, the controls are simple, and the upgrade system is surprisingly complex, yet easy to understand. When a run starts working, and all your power-ups start synergizing, it feels wonderful. The graphics are gorgeous, too, though I've always been a sucker for stylized pixel graphics with a limited color scheme. Would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone.","2024-05-01T00:12:32.735Z"
"Rhowen MacKeigan",5,"it's a very fun game!! a perfect way to kill time. I was a bit worried when I saw it had ads, but it's only to revive, or get upgraded. they never force you to watch an ad","2024-08-01T22:12:13.460Z"

"Matthew Augart-Peponis",5,"Awesome game. It's a joy to create your build and work your way up to achieving OP combos. That said, as others have noted, after the 8-10 minute mark you've already won. Eg: I play a dark ritual + reaper bullets build when I can. Enemies die to curse (boosting base damage which boosts curse), explode into splinters (or plague activates), new enemies get curse, repeat. It's fun, but I'm in no real danger. Still, awesome game, 10/10","2024-06-15T20:01:07.518Z"
"–ë–æ—è–Ω –¢–∏—Ö–æ–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤",5,"The game is actually very addicting. It has interesting characters, each with different abilities. There are also runes you can buy and upgrade that will boost you a little through the game. Also when you are leveling up, you can pick one from a few buffs that can make crazy combos together and/or with the character's abilities. Plus there are bosses and difficulty levels. In my opinion its worth a try. Although if i could add one thing into the game it would be an ""endless mode"".","2024-06-02T12:51:01.632Z"

"Matthew Casio",5,"Honestly the game's very addicting, I could play for 5 hours. I like the simple game loop along with the characters and weapon choices which makes the gameplay more random especially with the pickups after you kill enough ones. It'd be nice if you guys keep on bringing more characters and guns to choose from but just right now, this game is really good. Keep up the great work guys, oh and hey I recommend using Lilith with the bat gun, with the ""Splinter"" upgrade choice, it gets very easy!","2024-05-15T12:23:42.407Z"

"Brandyn Turner",5,"I own this on Steam as well, and Tthe mobile version does not disappoint. Ads are completely optional and mostly just give you a boost or revive, but you still get the core experience without them. Game play is essentially a bullet-hell, survivors, rogue-like experience.

My only 2 complaints is that Runes should be double-tapped or at least need confirmation in order to change them because I've had at least a dozen cases where I accidentally unequipped or changed them. And that there should be a way to disable the fire button for those trying to get the Pacifist and Reckless achievements.

Lilith among my favorite to play has a game breaking feature to be mindful of.

"Kyle N",5,"20 Minutes Till Dawn is one of the best mobile games I've played. It's a fun and challenging top-down 2D roguelike shooter similar to Enter the Gungeon or Vampire Survivors. It played perfectly on my phone. Games last 20-25 minutes, though there is a 10 minute game option. Every character feels unique, and there are a variety of builds you can play.

The bosses are pretty easy and I think adding more moves for the boss to do would help with that problem. Like the first boss on Forest only really lunges are you and nothing else.

And when opening a chest there should also be a timer, or else it ends up with the player running into a enemy!

"Nikhil",5,"the Mose amazing mobile game I've played and trust me i don't get impressed easily and I'm a game designer. it's gonna start slow but eventually it's getting soo much fast and interesting","2024-06-27T07:49:48.509Z"
"Brody Haskins",5,"Love the game. Even more, I appreciate how the ads are, as far as I've seen, reliably 30 seconds long. It adds to how they somehow already feel mostly optional in this game. I feel like I'm actually making my character rather than just a character, if that makes sense. Not quite the same as some other apps I use for dopamining, but uniquely different in a way that I think is totally worth checking out.","2023-09-02T19:32:45.539Z"
"ABD Beanman",5,"This game pretty much NEEDS an endless mode, other than that no complaints, it's a very good game, somewhat lacking in synergies and achievements, the difficulty could be increased, but it is incredibly fun. Suggestions: Endless mode More difficulties/More bosses More synergies More achievements Definitely a more interesting gun, the current ones (except the batgun and bow) are somewhat lacking in diversity Meta Upgrades should also have another tier, something like ""Free one-time rerolls""","2022-11-16T20:42:17.194Z"
"disan tangeb",5,"The games great! If only the achievement is easier to spot, that would be great. I can't really differentiate which achievement I've completed since the color scheme is hard to differentiate. That's my only complain about this game. Other, than that, this game delivers!","2023-11-03T00:49:12.909Z"
"Chonyc Perreault",5,"Amazing game you've made. No complaints from me. Except for the fact that there are SO many in-app purchases. Now, I do get that you have to make money somehow, expecly since you made 20 Minutes Till Dawn a free-to-play game. However, I do wish that there was some way to unlock stuff via grinding and only grinding. Otherwise, I think it's an absolutely perfect game.","2024-02-01T01:56:00.339Z"
"Alp Ucar",5,"It is a surprisingly fair mobile game considering the progression of new characters and weapons. Default charecter ability is reroll, which is great to try and learn all the upgrade trees. Another great one is infinite comeback from death via watching an ad. It does not push you to grind for hours or to buy ingame currencies to try out things. You finish two, ten minute runs and you earn enough to buy 3 new charecters or items. Simple but very satisfying visuals and sounds.","2023-09-17T01:46:21.855Z"
"Marshal Byrd-Queripel",5,"So I've played this game on pc and was pretty surprised to see it while browsing the app store. The version on steam I've been playing is pretty damn cheap and it's a game I've put a fair few hours into. As for the mobile version I'd recommend it, seems to be full featured and then a few free to play additions, plays surprisingly well on mobile with the caveat that the auto-aim feature is a bit busted.","2022-12-26T08:55:48.840Z"
"Henry M",5,"No ads if you don't want to watch any at all, this is the free version and there is soo much action and things to do. It feels rewarding to survive 20 minutes instead of those games like surviver.io where they pass out free wins everywhere. Good controls, amazing game play, stop reading reviews and get the game already!!","2022-12-13T13:32:50.511Z"
"Express",5,"Great game to just kill time with, no popup or unwanted ads, the only ads are for respawning when dying which kind of ruins the point of a game like this but I can just ignore it, solid mobile game with simple controls though, shoot and kill and upgrade, doesnt get any simpler than that, and its alot of fun The performance got worse after the last update, I dont know what changed but theres a lot of stutter and I hope it gets fixed soon","2022-11-27T05:08:48.774Z"
"Connor Rogers",5,"its very fun but hard but with the right combos you can easily beat it","2024-08-28T01:19:19.571Z"
"Kara Segan",5,"Amazing game, currently my favorite mobile game. Gameplay never gets boring and I like trying out the variety of guns and characters. The art is nice too. I hope to see more enemies to be added in the future, unless there's some in the new map (which I haven't got to yet üòÖ) Keep up the great work!","2022-12-08T18:53:48.100Z"
"Mi Du",5,"For me it only 10 minutes until I die but it's a great game. Trying to push to 15 minutes LOL","2024-07-05T02:52:43.594Z"
"Wade Stoddard",5,"I got this game with the play pass and without it it might have been very challenging to get to 220 minutes. make certain you upgrade your shield and attack it's under the ruins this will help you if you don't have the play pass it will take a very long time to to beat in 10 minutes. Fun to play through.","2023-11-30T16:34:44.508Z"
"Robert Stokes",5,"This is probably the best free roguelike game on the mobile market right now. The only times you get ads are if you willingly make an ad appear. Although I wish the game were a bit easier, and that some abilities were more useful compared to others (seriously, ricochet is too op), this game is very very good. There are different builds and combinations you can do and try, and it's fun to play. Not as good as something like hades, but still one of the best mobile games out there.","2023-07-15T07:45:08.325Z"
"mohamad deab",5,"It does the Vampire Survivors exp upgrade thing, but with the twist of being able to attack on your own will. It gives you the choice of sacrificing damage and attacking for collecting exp and getting some distance from the enemies. It is really fun, and the beating the first darkness level feals so rewarding. Really cool game. üëç","2023-08-24T18:57:04.230Z"
"Tex",5,"Pretty solid roguelike game, you can have fun with making builds with different characters, but that's it. Kinda wish the game offered something more than smashing hordes of enemies and occasionally bosses - different locations, small events - but I'm sure those will come in the future. Also really anticipating endless mode - it's pretty sad to lose too OP runs ;)","2022-12-14T11:20:33.453Z"
